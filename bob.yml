Search Field Match Type: IN

Search Field Merge Type: ANY

# The "Search Field Match Type" parameter which can be one of:

# IN
# (short for index)
# Treat the value as a list of whitespace-seperated words. Search for each one in the full-text index.
# In the case of subjects, match these subject ids or the those of any of their decendants in the subject tree.

# EQ
# (short for equal)
# Treat the value as a single string. Match only fields which have this value.

# EX
# (short for exact)
# If the value is an empty string then search for fields which are empty, as oppose to skipping this search field.
# In the case of subjects, match the specified subjects, but not their decendants.

# SET
# If the value is non-empty.

# NO
# This is only really used internally, it means the search field will just fail to match anything without doing any actual searching.

# The "Search Field Merge Type" parameter can be one of:

# ANY
# Match an item if any of the space-separated words in the value match.

# ALL
# Match an item only if all of the space-separated words in the value match.

# "Search Field Merge Type" has no affect on EX matches, which always match the entire value.
